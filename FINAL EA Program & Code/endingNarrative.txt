You: Please raise your head, Mr. Astrea. We were just doing the right thing.
Mr. Astrea: I will make sure to repay you both the next time we cross paths you have my word. 
Well, I must get my daughter to safety. I cannot stay for long or they will find me.
You: Take care of yourself and your daughter, Mr. Astrea!
Mr. Astrea: Oh before, I leave. I want you to know that the curse will break at midnight. At that point, everything will become normal for you.
You: Oh that's right. One of the hooded men said that I have a curse. Also, you have not told me how do you know me before.
Mr. Astrea: Do not worry about the curse because it will be broken soon. As far as knowing you, I told you it was a conversation for another day.

These were Mr. Astrea's last words before he left with his daughter. 
You surely were left with more questions. 
Soon, Lars left and you thanked him for being there with you the entire time. 
Once you are alone, you took a moment to think about your day. 
So much happened in one day that the thought of it is simply overwhelming. 
You wonder if you will see Will von Astrea again. 
While lost in contemplation, midnight arrives and a new day begins. 
You make your way to bed and collapse wondering what the next day has in store for you.

*
With help from you and your friend, I was able to rescue my dear daughter. 
Words can not express my gratitude.
