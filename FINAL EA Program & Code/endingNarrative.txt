You: Please raise your head Mr. Astrea we were just doing the right thing.

Mr. Astrea: I will make sure to repay you both the next time we cross paths you have my word. 
Well, I must get my daughter to safety. I cannot stay for long or they will find me.

You: Take care of yourself and your daughter Mr. Astrea!

Mr. Astrea: Oh before I leave… I want you to know that the curse will break once the clock hits 12:00 a.m. Which means everything will return back to normal again for you.

You: Oh that is right one of those hooded man said something about me being the one with the curse. Also, you have not told me how do you knew me before.

Mr. Astrea: Do not worry about the curse anymore for it will be broken soon. As far as knowing you I told you it was a conversation for another day.

These were Mr. Astrea’s last word before taking his leave with his daughter. 
You surely were left with more questions than answers. 
Soon after, Lars took his leave as well and you gave him your thanks for being there with you the entire time. 
Once alone you took a moment to think about your day. 
So much happened in one single day that the thought of it is simply overwhelming. 
You wonder if you will truly see Will von Astrea again. 
While lost in contemplation 12:00 a.m. arrives and a new day begins. 
You make your way to bed and collapse wondering what the next day has in store for you.

THANKS FOR PLAYING.

With your help and the help of your friend I was able to rescue my dear daughter. 
Words can’t express the extent of my gratitude.
