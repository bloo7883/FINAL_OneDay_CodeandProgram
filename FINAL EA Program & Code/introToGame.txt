The sound of an alarm clock wakes you up. Friday has arrived and you have school. 
You go on with your daily morning routine, which you get ready and eat breakfast. 
Once you are done, you begin to make your way to school. 
So far, Friday is just another ordinary day. School is not that far, so you arrive early. 
Since there is nothing else to do, you head straight to class. 
Along the way, you come across a commotion. You see a small group in the distance. 
The group turns out to be four boys. Three boys are kicking the life out of the boy. 
What do you do?
