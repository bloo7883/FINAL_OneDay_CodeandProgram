From the darkness, you are back in the present moment by the loud ring that indicates lunchtime. 
You are confused about what just happened because you remember dying. You take a couple minutes to come to terms with reality.  
You come to the conclusion that you are not dreaming. 
You are alive. You ask yourself, "What does that mean?"
"Could it all just be a daydream gone wrong? Who knows?" You make your way down the stairs to the cafeteria. 
While you are walking down the stairs, you bump into someone who seems to be in a hurry.  
You realize that it is the same boy from earlier, but not only that the memories of your death return to you. 
He is the same boy that killed you. Unable to move or talk, you drown in the fear and pain of that very moment. 
The boy ignores you and continues walking upstairs. 
You slowly turn to watch him walk. You noticed a metal-like object his hand.  
In that moment, you know that he is holding is a gun. 
You are faced with the same options. Would you like to?

From the darkness, you are brought back to the present moment. 
You find yourself in front of a door to a classroom. 
The door has a small glass window in the middle through which you can peer into the classroom. 
As you take a closer look, you can see a boy holding a gun. You recognize this boy. 
His familiarity brings about the memories of your death. He is the same boy that killed you. 
Unable to move or talk, you drown in the fear and pain of that very moment. 
You begin to think about the possibility of going insane. 
The boundary between reality and illusion is no longer visible to you. 
You know you died because of such certainty you are left with the question,"What is happening to me?"
Unable to come with an answer right away, you are faced with the same options. So, what will you do?
