From the darkness you are brought back to the present moment by the loud ring which indicates lunch time. 
Confused as to what just happened because you clearly remember dying you take a couple minutes to come to terms with reality. 
You come to the conclusion that there is no doubt in your mind you are not dreaming. 
You are alive. "But what does that mean?", you ask yourself. 
"Could it all just been a daydream gone wrong? Who knows..", you conclude and with that you make your way down the stairs to the cafeteria. 
While walking down the stairs you bump with someone who seems to be in a hurry. 
You realize that it is the same boy from earlier but not only that the memories of your death return to you. He is the same boy that killed you. 
Unable to move or talk you drown in the fear and pain of that very moment. 
The boy ignores you and continues walking upstairs. 
You slowly turn to watch him go and catch something metal like in one of his hands. 
In that moment you know that what he is holding is actually a gun. 
You are faced with the same options… Would you like to?

From the darkness you are brought back to the present moment. 
You find yourself in front of a door to a classroom. 
The door has a small glass window in the middle through which you can peer into the classroom. 
As you take a closer look you can see a boy holding a gun. You recognize this boy. 
His familiarity brings about the memories of your death. He is the same boy that killed you. 
Unable to move or talk you drown in the fear and pain of that very moment. 
You begin to think about the possibility of  you going insane. 
The boundary between reality and illusion is no longer visible to you. 
You know you died for certain and because of such certainty you are left with the question, "What is happening to me?" 
Unable to come with an answer right away you are faced with the same options… So what will you do?

From the darkness you are brought back to the present moment. 
You find yourself in the middle of a toast proposal by the small group. 
You take a look towards the door where you last saw the thief and see two hooded figures go in. 
At this very moment it becomes evident to you that you had just died. 
Shocked by this fact you try your hardest to remember how you died. 
After a couple of seconds small glimpses of your memory return to you. 
You became weak and collapsed a few hours after the toast. 
By the time you came about you were unable to move and were surrounded by hooded figures. 
They were talking about having found the “one” with the curse and about preparations being ready. 
Next thing you remember your body is bleeding from all places and the pain is unprecedented. 
Before you lose yourself completely within such memories the small group calls out to you. 
Everyone is getting ready to toast. Will you?
