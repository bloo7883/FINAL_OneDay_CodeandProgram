He gives you a knife cutting stare before speaking.

Lars: I have been bullied since I was little. Every single time, no one bothered to move a finger.  
My anger is too much! My pain has gotten worse! I will make sure they all feel it!

You: Do you think killing everyone will solve anything? 
You really think exerting your revenge will get rid of your pain and suffering? 
Do you have any idea the extent of pain you are about to cause? 
Your pain and suffering will be nothing compared to the pain and suffering of a dozen families. 
Unlike you, they will live with the pain for the rest of their lives. 
How will your actions be justified then?

Silence fills the room after your last question. 
The boy slowly lowers his gaze, as well as his gun. After a few seconds of reflection, he responds with...

Lars: I may not know you, but I do remember you.
Earlier this morning, you chose to ignore the situation like everyone else.
You are nothing, but a hypocrite. I hate hypocrites! You will die as a hypocrite.

Unable to respond, the boy fires a shot. The shot pierces your chest as you begin to bleed profusely. Your body loses all balance and hits the floor. You have never felt pain like this before. 
Within your last breaths, you begin to regret not having intervened at that time.
Now because of your decisions, your death is evident. 
After a few more seconds, the pain ceases and darkness clouds your vision. You are dead.

The boy recognizes you from this morning and he asks you why are you here. 
You answer him with: 
You: I am here to convince you that what you are about to do is wrong.

He gives you the same stare he gave you this morning only this time he speaks after his stare.

Lars: I have been bullied since I was little. Every single time, no one bothered to move a finger. 
You were the first person to help me out of your own goodness. 
That small act gave me hope. In the end, my anger is too much, my pain is too great, and I can never forgive!

You: So what! Do you think killing everyone will solve anything? 
You really think exerting your revenge will get rid of your pain and suffering? 
Do you have any idea the extent of pain you are about to cause? 
Your pain and suffering will be nothing compared to the pain and suffering of a dozen families. 
Unlike you, they will live with the pain for the rest of their lives. 
How will your actions be justified then?

Silence fills the room after your last question. The boy slowly lowers his gaze as well as his gun. After a few seconds of reflection he responds with...

Lars: You are right… You are right…

The boy drops the gun and begins to drown in tears. 
You look around confused and weirded out. You pat him on the back once and step away. 
It is understandable, you think to yourself if he was ready to carry out a horrible act. 
One can only imagine all the pain and hatred that he had to live with. 
After a few minutes, you tell him that it is time to go. 
He agrees and you guys make your way down to some benches outside of the cafeteria. 
Once you are there, you talk for the remainder of lunch.
