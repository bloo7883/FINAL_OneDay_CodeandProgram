You walk past them and head for class. You hear him screaming "I will kill you all!" from far away. 
At this point, you can sense the pain in those words. 
Sympathy won't work for you after making your decision.
*
You successfully stop the bullying by resorting to persuasion. The boy slowly gets up and thanks you. You tell him to not worry after you did the right thing. 
He stares at you for a second and didn't say anything. 
After the silence becomes awkward, you tell him that you hope to see him again. You start to go to class.
*
You finally reach the cafeteria. It is full of students as always. 
As a result, the noise levels are off the charts. 
The commotion disappeared as you begin to enjoy your food. 
After a couple of minutes, your attention is brought back to your surroundings. 
You hear screams and sounds that resemble fireworks. 
You quickly notice the masses that are running in panic and confusion. 
You begin to run after you didn't understand the situation. 
During the chaos, you find yourself slipping over a red fluid. 
You raise your head as you see a dead student. The red fluid is blood and you are covered in it. 
You immediately freak out and get up. There are almost 12 casualties. 
Upon turning around, you see the boy who was bullied. You can see him holding a gun. 
He was aiming at you as you could not react. You felt as if you were frozen in time by your terror. 
This was your first time facing death. The boy opened fire and you felt the impact in your chest. 
You fell to the floor bleeding profusely. You have never felt pain like this before. 
Within your last breaths, you begin to regret not following your instinct. 
Now, 12 students are dead because of your decisions. You will soon join them. 
After a few seconds, the pain ceases and darkness clouds your vision. You are dead. 
*
You make sure that the boy does not notice you following him. Eventually, he enters a classroom. 
You approach the classroom and peek through a small glass window of the door. 
You can see the classroom is empty. You ask yourself, "Why would he be in an empty classroom?" 
As you continue to observe, you notice he takes out the metallic object he was holding earlier. 
This time you can recognize that it is a gun. You know where this is going.  
That boy was going to take revenge on students who bullied him, but there was a chance he might take it on anyone. You have to think! What would be best for a course of action?
*
Without wasting any time, you run through the hallways until you find a security guard. 
You quickly explain the situation to him. 
The security guard immediately informs the police and the rest of the school's security. 
They begin the search after the alarm sounds in the entire school. 
The boy knows that they are looking for him. 
After a couple of minutes, they catch him near the cafeteria. 
He flees until there is nowhere to flee to. Before he was apprehended, he chose to end his life. 
School was closed at once. The incident was documented and investigated. 
They questioned you for quite the time, but amidst the interrogation only one thought resided within your mind. That being the possibility that he could have been saved.
*
You open the door carefully and not completely open. 
You don't want to cause the boy to shoot out of fear. 
He sees you and points his gun directly at you. 
You quickly put your hands up, so you let him know that you are not a threat.
*
You feel as if you will only survive if you fight. 
You grab two knives from the knive set and hold one tightly in each arm. 
The thief tells you that he does not want to hurt you, he just wants you to hand over any valuables you possess without any resistance. 
Unable to believe the thief you launch an attack before he gets any closer to you. 
He successfully dodges and throws you against one of the walls. 
You hit the wall hard and fall to the floor. 
The thief quickly tries to pin you in the hopes of stopping your swings with the knives. 
He is not fast enough however, you stab him with your free hand in one of his legs. 
He screams in pain and drops to the floor. Unable to move or stand he possess no threat to you.

Lars finally arrives and checks up on you. You tell him that everything is under control. 
You both begin to decide what to do with the thief. 
Before you are allowed to address the thief he pleads for something to wrap around his injury. 
He also says he will leave in peace once he can stand. You both agree reluctantly. 
The thief provides his apologies as well as his gratitude before disappearing. 
*
You give up thinking it is the best course of action. 
The thief tells you that he does not want to hurt you, he just wants you to hand over the valuables you possess without any resistance. 
Once the thief gets what he wants he says thank you and sorry at the same time. 
Shocked and appalled you ask him why is he saying thank you and sorry. 
He tells you his apologies are for stealing from you. He does not tell you the reasoning behind his gratitude. 
All he says is that he has no choice but to steal all he can before something terrible happens. 
Upon preparing to take his leave he is confronted by Lars, who is pointing a gun at him. 
You tell Lars to not shot and he tells you to not worry. Lars then demands the thief to leave all that he has stolen. The thief does so carefully. 
After that, Lars tells the thief to get out and never come back and without haste he does so. 
You take a deep breath before thanking Lars. 
He tells you that it is no problem since he owes you a huge debt. 
You tell him there is no need to feel that way. 
Before Lars gets the chance to respond you invite him for a walk.. He of course agrees.
*
You: That is what we are going to find out Lars. 
Him being here as a complete coincidence is what is impossible. Get ready… 
There is no knowing what will go down once we go through that door.

Once you both enter through the door you begin looking for the thief. Unfortunately he is nowhere to find. 
After a couple of minutes, you and Lars are surprised by two tall hooded figures. 
One of them says that they must kill the other one and leave the one with the curse untouched. 
The hooded man says this while pointing at you. 
Unable to understand you tell Lars to get ready. 
However, from behind the thief appears from the cover of the shadows and strikes one of the hooded figures. The other hooded figure was knocked out by Lars while he was caught by surprise. 
With both hooded figures unconscious you took this opportunity to ask the thief. 
You: Why are you here thief?

Thief: We meet again... I cannot believe our paths have crossed a second time out of mere coincidence. I am here looking for something that is precious to me beyond anything else.

You: But that still means you are here to steal away such thing right?

Thief: No you are mistaking... I am here for my daughter...
I came to rescue her from the clutches of this forsaken cult.

You: Your daughter? Then this two hooded figures are cult members?

Thief: Yes, this party is hosted by them. 
By hosting such party they can move with more ease.

You: Why did they take your daughter away?

Thief: I deserted this cult not long ago... 
I just could not stand the atrocities being committed so I left but they took my dear daughter as a consequence. 
They told me that as long as I kept a stream of cash flowing in they would keep my daughter alive…

You: So you began stealing correct? That is why you broke into my house?

Thief: That is correct and once again I apologize… Now if you excuse me I have to look for my daughter.

You: Lars and I will help you! What is your name?

Thief: My name is Will von Astrea and I know who you are...”<<endl;
You: You do Mr. Astrea?”<<end;

Mr. Astrea: Yes but that is a conversation for later. Let's move, more will show.

You, Lars, and Will von Astrea begin your search deeper within the house. 
Eventually you both find a small girl all tied up. Mr. Astrea hurries and unties her. 
He has indeed found his daughter. As he checks up on her you can hear people getting closer. 
With nowhere to run you begin to lose hope but Mr. Astrea shows you and Lars through a secret passage. You all successfully escape. 
Once outside you recommend that the next destination should be your house. Lars and Mr. Astrea agree.
*
You and Lars accept and the small group goes wild in excitement. 
After a good ten minutes you see two hooded figures go through the same door. 
Maybe the thief’s luck was about to run out but the thought quickly left your mind as your attention was directed to a toast being proposed. You could either:
*
The toast is splendid. You and Lars exchange stories with the small group until you find yourself in complete darkness. What just happened you ask yourself?
*
You put your drink down and make your way towards the door where you last saw the thief and the two hooded figure go through. 
Once in you are confronted by the two hooded figure who seem to be looking for someone. 
One of them says something about you being the one with the curse while pointing at you. 
Unable to understand you get ready to defend yourself. 
However, the thief appears from the cover of the shadows and strikes one of the hooded figures down. 
You use this chance to strike down the other hooded figure. 
With both threats neutralized you use this opportunity to ask the thief.

You: Why are you here thief?

Thief: We meet again... I cannot believe our paths have crossed a second time out of mere coincidence. I am here looking for something that is precious to me beyond anything else.

He is not fast enough however, you stab him with your free hand in one of his legs. 
He screams in pain and drops to the floor. Unable to move or stand he possess no threat to you.

The police arrive within two minutes. 
They provide the thief with medical treatment and is then taken away into custody. 
You are asked questions and inspected as well for any injuries. 
You are told you pulled a few strains in your left leg. 
As a result, your movements would be limited. After the police left you decided to take a walk to refresh yourself.
*
You give up thinking it is the best course of action. 
The thief tells you that he does not want to hurt you, he just wants you to hand over the valuables you possess without any resistance. 
You hand over some valuables to satisfy the thief. 
Once the thief gets what he wants he says thank you and sorry at the same time. 
Shocked and appalled you ask him why is he saying thank you and sorry. 
He tells you his apologies are for stealing from you. 
He does not tell you the reasoning behind his gratitude. 
All he says is that he has no choice but to steal all he can before something terrible happens. 
Unable to investigate the thief further sirens are heard. Police were on their way. 
The thief quickly takes all of the valuables you gave him and runs through the back door. 
Eventually the police come in and begin asking all sorts of questions. 
You try to answer them as best as you can. 

Once the interrogations were over and the police left you decided to take a walk. 
Throughout this walk you began to think about your encounter with the thief. 
It became evident to you that he was no ordinary thief. He was stealing out of desperation. 
It was clear that he must have some serious problems but further thought into the matter does not interest you. Instead, you decided to take a walk for some fresh air.
*
You turn down their invitation in an abrupt manner and start heading towards the door where you last saw the thief. You know that you will need to be ready for whatever goes down after you go through that door. Once you go through the door you start looking for the thief but he is nowhere to be seen. After a couple of minutes you are surprised from behind by two hooded figures. One of them says that the one with the curse has been found while pointing at you. Unable to understand you get ready to fight for your life. However, from behind the thief appears from the cover of the shadows and strikes one of the hooded figures. You quickly strike the other hooded figure the moment he turns his back on you. Both hooded figures are now laying on the floor unconscious. You take this time to question the thief.

You: Why are you here thief?

We meet again... I cannot believe our paths have crossed a second time out of mere coincidence. I am here looking for something that is precious to me beyond anything else.

But that still means you are here to steal away such thing right?
