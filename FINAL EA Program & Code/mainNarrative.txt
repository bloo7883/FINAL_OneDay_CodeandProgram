You realize that it is the same boy from earlier. 
He ignores you and continues walking upstairs without offering you an apology.

The thud sounds seem to come from the back door of the house. 
As you are alarmed, you take a closer look. The thud sounds get louder as you approach the back door. 
It seems someone was trying to break in. Without haste, you dial 911 and explain the situation. 
They begin to ask too many questions, which you are unable to answer as the thuds intensify. 
You are able to give them your address before the thief makes it past the back door.

As you are alarmed, you begin to investigate. 
The loud thuds came from the back door. It became clear to you someone was trying to break in.
